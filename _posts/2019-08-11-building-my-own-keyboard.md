title: Building my own keyboard (in progress)
---

This is a living report of my attempt to build my own keyboard. I am deeply dissatisfied
with the current offer, and I see no other way than to design my own.

Recently I joined Makespace Cambridge. It's a community workshop with a wide availability 
of tools, such as 3d printers, laser cutters, milling machines and so on. The initial motivation
was to gather python enthusiasts interested in exploring more complex topics in the language, but 
this is a story for another time. In any case, with my membership, came the need for a project, 
and I thought I never really had a pleasant experience with keyboards.

# What do I want from a keyboard?

So, what's my Ideal Keyboard (TM)? It must have

- two halves. My wrists demand it. The Kinesis Freestyle is a great model that served me well, but it has its limitations.
- No numeric keypad. It's a waste of space, I never use it, and forces me to move the hand and arm too much to reach the mouse.
- No useless keys. Enough with the caps lock, the print screen, scroll lock, pause.
- Add new keys: I program in R, so I would really love a key that sends the "<-" assignment.
- No split keys for up-down cursor. That thing is pure garbage.
- Programmable displays to show up-to-date information (e.g. build status)
- Fully programmable macro keys on the left hand side. Basically a keybow pimoroni integrated in the keyboard. 
  Bonus point if the keys also have an OLED display (but they are pricey)
- must be pleasant to use in terms of touch ergonomics, but not too noisy.
- must look cool.

Basically, this is the layout I want
