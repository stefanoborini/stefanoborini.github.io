# Baseplate 

I managed to get my hands on the 1.5 mm acrylic and build a double layered 3mm thick baseplate.
It was horribly expensive, and unfortunately only available in transparent. Unfortunately because
this kind of makes a LEDs no longer an option, as they would shine through the baseplate and not 
illuminate precisely one key. Aluminum is still an option I am considering, or paint, but for now
LEDs are not my top priority.

I created the baseplate by cutting two layers: the first layer as normal, and the second by 
enlarging slightly the holes for the switches. I just used the laser cutter software to do it.
Then, I used cyanoacrylate glue to stick the two layers together. This creates a 3mm sandwich that 
has lips in each switch hole. On these lips the Cherry locks just perfectly.

The main problem with this method is that cyanoacrylate is very fast curing. I
need a slower curing glue for the bigger baseplates. The most appropriate glue
for this task seems to be [Tensol
12](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07G4Z1PFT/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=A1ODUIM79K8PMU&psc=1)
which has an initial setting time of 3 hours and a final setting time of 24
hours. Not perfect, but I can deal with it.


# Connecting Arduino with the Raspberry Pi

- Use the new matrix to verify the firmware
- send actual scancodes using Wire.

# PCB

- wait for the PCB
- order all the parts.
- test it.


# The keycaps

- edit the thingiverse spacebar
- 3d print one
- try acetone smoothing
