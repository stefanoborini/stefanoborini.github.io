title: PyQt Gotchas
---

PyQt and Qt have a fundamental conflict: memory management. Python frees stuff
when references go out of scope, while Qt, being based on C++, has no such
automatic mechanism for free storage data (that is, stuff allocated with new).
Qt obviates to this problem by using a hierarchy: when the parent is deleted,
the children are deleted in cascade.  Unfortunately, this can create a lot of
hard-to-debug chaos in two cases:

* if the Qt mechanism (which knows nothing about python) deletes a C++ object while we are holding a python object pointing to that C++ one.

* if python deletes a python object because it goes out of scope, and that object is still referenced and used by Qt at the C++ level.

Both cases will lead to access to freed memory, leading to undefined behavior. Let's see some examples to make things clear.

## Gotcha #1: Using WA_DeleteOnClose

Never use WA_DeleteOnClose.

```python
import sys
from PyQt4 import QtGui, QtCore

class Main(QtGui.QPushButton):
  def __init__(self, parent=None):
      QtGui.QPushButton.__init__(self, parent)
      self._label = QtGui.QLabel("hello")
      self._label.setAttribute(QtCore.Qt.WA_DeleteOnClose)   # Gotcha
      self.clicked.connect(self.showLabel)

  def showLabel(self, *args):
      self._label.show()

if __name__ == "__main__":
  app = QtGui.QApplication(sys.argv)
  widget = Main()
  widget.show()
  sys.exit(app.exec_())
```

Launch the example, and press the button. A label will be shown. Close the
label, and press the button again. The following error occurs: "RuntimeError:
wrapped C/C++ object of type QLabel has been deleted". The reason is that when
the label is closed, the C++ object is deleted, but we are still holding a
reference to it via the self._label python object. Any attempt to use the
self._label object will involve a deleted backend, with bad consequences.

## Gotcha #2: Using a parent that has local scope for a child that has broader scope 

Launch the example, and press the button twice.

```python
import sys
from PyQt4 import QtGui, QtCore

class Main(QtGui.QPushButton):
   def __init__(self, parent=None):
      QtGui.QPushButton.__init__(self, parent)
      self._counter = 0
      self.clicked.connect(self.doThing)

  def doThing(self, *args):
      if self._counter == 0:
          widget = QtGui.QWidget()                          # Gotcha
          self._label = QtGui.QLabel("hello", widget)       # Gotcha
          self._label.show()
      elif self._counter == 1:
          self._label.setText("whatever")

      self._counter += 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
   app = QtGui.QApplication(sys.argv)

  widget = Main()
  widget.show()

  sys.exit(app.exec_())
```

What happens here is that the parent of the label (widget) is local in scope, and its child is kept around as self._label.
When widget goes out of scope in python, it is freed. This triggers a C++ delete of the children. However, we are still holding
a reference to the python object representing one of the children (self._label), which is now referring to freed memory.

## Gotcha #3: Using deleteLater

Launch the example, and press the button three times.

```python
import sys
from PyQt4 import QtGui, QtCore

class Main(QtGui.QPushButton):
  def __init__(self, parent=None):
      QtGui.QPushButton.__init__(self, parent)
      self._counter = 0
      self.clicked.connect(self.doThing)

  def doThing(self, *args):
      if self._counter == 0:
          self._label = QtGui.QLabel("hello")
          self._label.show()
      elif self._counter == 1:
          self._label.setText("whatever")
      elif self._counter == 2:
          self._label.deleteLater()
      elif self._counter > 2:
          self._label.setText("whatever")

      self._counter += 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
  app = QtGui.QApplication(sys.argv)

  widget = Main()
  widget.show()

  sys.exit(app.exec_())
```

The problem here is due to deleteLater(). This routine schedules a deletion of a widget for later, but in doing so, only the C++ object is freed. The python object stays alive and again references freed memory.

## Non-Gotcha: using local scope for child widgets

In this example, 2 subwidgets are added to the layout of a main widget. Access to the widgets are provided only by using the C++ API of Qt, ie. without setting a Python
'self' reference.

```python
import sys
from PyQt4 import QtGui

class A(QtGui.QLabel):
  def __init__(self, parent=None):
      QtGui.QLabel.__init__(self, parent)

class B(QtGui.QLabel):
  def __init__(self, parent=None):
      QtGui.QLabel.__init__(self, parent)

class Widget(QtGui.QWidget):
  def __init__(self):
      QtGui.QWidget.__init__(self)

      # Base layout
      layout = QtGui.QVBoxLayout(self)

      # Add widgets
      a = A(self)                          # Here
      b = B(self)                          # Here

      layout.addWidget(a)
      layout.addWidget(b)

  def a(self):
      return self.layout().itemAt(0).widget()

  def b(self):
      return self.layout().itemAt(1).widget()

if __name__ == "__main__":
   app = QtGui.QApplication(sys.argv)

  widget = Widget()
  widget.show()
  print widget.a()
  print widget.b()

  sys.exit(app.exec_())
```

This is not a problem, because PyQt is clever enough to increment the python
reference count of the objects a and b. In this case, when the a and b objects
go out of scope, the underlying C++ is not deleted as a cascade effect of the
python decrement reference count.
