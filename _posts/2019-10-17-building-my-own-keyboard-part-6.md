I laser cut the complete baseplate. Laser files provided. Link.

screwed the screw space. Need rework.

- create new baseplate and design the screw setup


# PCB

Soldering the PCB components took me a whole day, but I found myself strangely absorbed at the zen-like activity of soldering
with a microscope. I thought it was much harder, but with a steady hand, a good technique with the solder, iron, and tweezers,
and some good tune, I managed to solder all the diodes and the kailh hot-plugs.

It is of particular importance to keep close attention to the diode directionality, indicated by a small yellow band.
Keep into account that these diodes are the size of a sesame seed, and the contacts are the size of a grain of sand.

The final result is very pleasing:

That said, I doubt I will use the kailh hot-plugs in the final model. They were
hard to find, and they provide little advantage for the final product, besides
the ability to replace a switch easily. But seriously, I don't think I'll ever
replace switches in the finished model. I do however want to keep this option
for the current prototypes, so I can reuse the switches in later prototypes and
finished product. The result is that I will have to rework the final PCB to
just provide through-hole solder pads for the switches.


# Debugging arduino/raspi connection woes

- check kernel i2c driver.

# The keycaps

- keep searching 3u spacebar DCS.
- search the DCS keycaps for the rest of the keyboard.
- order keycaps and costar stabilizers
- refine acetone process
