title: Building my own keyboard - Part 3 (in progress)
---

After the initial exploration, let's start small. The first step is to create a small 2x2 matrix 
and have arduino push out i2c data for the scan codes.

I am following the [excellent guide from the bald engineer](https://www.baldengineer.com/arduino-keyboard-matrix-tutorial.html)
and I managed to create this.
