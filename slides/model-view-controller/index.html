					<h4>Stefano Borini</h4>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        Good morning, today we are going to talk about Model View Controller and why it's good for you.
                        It's a central concept when you program graphical user interfaces, backend and frontend web.
                        It is not strictly a design pattern. It is instead a collection of patterns that forms a
                        design principle.

                        <li>Still very central in backend web programming.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Not to be confused with...</h3>
                    <dl>
                        <dt>Control</dt><dd>Another term for Widget.</dd>

                    <aside class="notes">
                        The model role is absolved by whatever object contains the state of your application.
                        Your whole application, without the UI, should be able to work through the model alone
                        (plus some other objects used to modify that state). What you gain is scriptability,
                        testability, and reusability.

                        Another important model duty is to notify whoever is interested in changes in its state
                        that a change has occurred.
                        
                        The view on the other hand, is generally stateless. It renders the model, listens to its
                        changes, and re-renders itself. It also provides a way to modify the model, but not directly.
                        Instead, it delegates to controllers, which encapsulate the logic to modify the model.

                        It's worth stressing that these are roles, not classes. A single class could take on multiple
                        roles, and many classes could be part of the same role. Classes that belong to the same role
                        are part of that role "layer" (e.g. model layer)

                    <h2>Command</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Encapsulates and bundles change operations to Model</li>
                        <li>Basically, a "smart" function to act on the Model</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Differences with Controller</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Controller is permanent. Command is ephemeral.</li>
                        <li>Controller "understands" the View. Command does not.</li>
                        <li>Controller translates. Command executes.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        Model View and Controller are not the only roles in an application. You can find also these ones quite often.
                        One could argue that Command is a sort of controller, but its nature is on demand and volatile. A controller
                        is generally permanent.

                    <ul>

                        <li>Used by Model, Controller and Command. Never by View.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Typical Examples</h4>
                    <p>Access to database, Docker, svn, git,<br />JSON serialization, REST client, process management.</p>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        Examples of services are things like database communication, network communication, process management etc.
                        You might consider them close to the Model layer, and in some cases model objects may use the service layer.

                        <li>Change version only when breaking backward compatibility</li>
                        <li>Always add to the format to preserve backward compatibility</li>
                        <li>Make old parsers ignore unknown entries (but see PNG)</li>
                        <li>Make new parsers provide defaults for missing new keys.</li>
                        <li>Upgrade on read. Don't keep old Model around.</li>

                    <h2>The event loop and the main thread</h2>
                    <p>UI programming is fundamentally event driven.</p>
                    <p>One thread (main thread) executes the event loop:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>waits for events (button clicks, keyboard button presses, timers...)</li>
                        <li>dispatches the events to the appropriate entities, synchronously.</li>
                        <li>perform all the operations consequential of the dispatching.</li>
                        <li>next loop iteration begins. Thread goes back to wait status.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>You have 200 msec per iteration, or application will feel frozen/sluggish</p>
                    <h3>If your operation takes longer, it must not be performed by the main thread</h3>
