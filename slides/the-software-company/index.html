				<section>
                    <h2>Typical scenario</h2>
                    <p>Multiple Scrum teams working on various parts of your business</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Frontend applications (end user product)</li>
                        <li>Backend</li>
                        <li>DevOps tasks</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>How can we optimize</p>

                        <li>Internal team performance</li>
                        <li>Interaction with external company groups</li>

                    <h2>Scrum organization: Sprint</h2>
                    <p>Two weeks sprints<br />
                    <small>(personal preference: three, but out of phase with month and possibly other teams. Four is too long)</small></p>
                    <p>Regular Scrum ceremonies (with caveats, see later)<br />
                    <small>planning and prioritisation, daily scrum, end of sprint demo, retrospective, end of sprint slack.</small></p>
                    <p>Standup at 9:30 <em>with</em> Scrum Master<br />
                    <small>Traditional Scrum: self-organising dev teams, with no need for SM at standup.<br />Personally against it. SM must be “in the trenches” and part of the team, but must not code</small></p>
                    <p>Information emitter (Scrum board): Post-it or Digital<br />
                    <small>Personal belief: tactile feedback of post-it notes has a positive effect on team focus.<br />Sadly, requires sync effort.</small></p>
                    <p>Scrum of Scrums: Tue/Thu at 10:00, with Scrum Masters <em>and</em> Product Owners<br />
                    <small>Reduces "PO <em>in absentia</em> effect", if occurring, by having PO in twice a week for questions</small></p>

                    <h2>Planning caveats - 1</h2>
                    <p>Goal: Improve effectiveness of the planning meeting (sprint day 1)</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Team+PO+SM (max 1 hour):</li> 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Present and discuss upcoming stories in order of priority.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Team+SM (few hours):</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Fragment stories (what to do) into easy to estimate, atomic technical tasks (how to do). Look at code/use team expertise.</li>
                            <li>Assign Story Points to tasks as follows: easy=1; medium=2; hard=3.<br />If more fragment more.</li>
                            <li>Compute Story total effort by summing the Tasks' Story Points.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Team+PO+SM (max 1 hour):</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Select what to do according to team estimates, velocity, availability.</li>
                            <li>Reprioritise/leave for next sprint if needed. 
                            Side effect: “accidental” refinement for upcoming sprint.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h2>Planning caveats - 2</h2>
                    <p><strong>Expected result at the end of day 1</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The team understood problems to solve <b>and</b> steps toward the solution.</li>
                        <li>The team knows exactly what needs to be done, where, and in which order.</li>
                        <li>The team learned more about various areas of the code.</li>
                        <li>The team knows tentatively: </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>who is the person implementing a given task</li>
                            <li>who is the reviewer 
                        </ul>
                        according to experience on that part of the code. </li>
                    </ul>

				<section>
                    <h2>Planning caveats - 3</h2>
                    <p><strong>Consequences</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Increase productivity, reduce mistakes and “no idea what I’m doing” factor.</li>
                        <li>Ensure at least two people know what is changing and if any code constraints must be preserved.</li>
                        <li>Support from SM needed to ensure proper load balancing among team members and reduce chance of code conflicts.</li>
                        <li>Team and PO see upcoming stories by backlog lookahead.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Teams tend to overestimate tasks: Story Point inflation. Controlled by matched increase in velocity, self-adapting to the team’s definition of easy/medium/hard.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>On planning poker</h2>
                    <p>Rough estimate for <strong>medium/long term</strong> "rule of thumb" planning.<br />
                        <small>Backed by little evidence, unlike the numbers obtained by the procedure given earlier.</small>
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li style="list-style-type: none">Management/executives must understand:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Story Points: fluctuating currency representing complexity, <strong>not</strong> days.</li>
                            <li>Planning poker results are not a promise, only an estimate with limited evidence to back it up.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
				</section>

				<section>
                    <h2>Bug triaging and handling</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>One team member every sprint is designated to assess<b> (not fix)</b> new bugs.  Team members rotate on the role.</li>
                        <li>Bug fixing either through Scrumban or dedicated sprints, depending on urgency and business pressure.<br>
                            <small>...but be wary of bugfix only sprints. They are heavy work.</small></li>
                        <li>Bugs are initially assigned to user-facing software subsystems. Eventually may reach internal subsystems after investigation.</li>
                        <li>Bugs are fixed in development. Fix is tested, then ported to production.</li>
                        <li>When using release branches, decide for either:
                        <ul>
                            <li>forward cherry pick (release -&gt; master) or</li>
                            <li>backward cherry pick (master -&gt; release)<br>
                            <small>Better option. Less likely to be forgotten halfway.</small></li>
                        </ul>
                        Not at random, or chaos will ensue.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>DevOps services</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mostly reactive (Kanban) but must have space for a Scrum process to optimise workflow and support tools</li>
                        <li>Ensure minimal internal solution development. "Go shopping", don't "build your own". Deprecate "build your own" whenever feasible.</li>
                        <li>Valid in general, but DevOps often generates homebrew solutions.</li>
                        <li>Focus on <b>your</b> core business and <b>your</b> core products. Buy the rest. Internal solutions have a hidden, sunken cost, and can become a white elephant in the long run.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Rule of three for internal solutions: make it, use it, bin it</strong></p>
				</section>

				<section>
                    <h2>Team productivity</h2>

                    <p>Team productivity (velocity) depends on:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Quality and flexibility of the codebase.</li>
                        <li>The power of their tools. Tools matter. Use the best tools available.</li>
                        <li>Ability to retrieve and consume missing information quickly.</li>
                        <li>Skills in the technology of choice.</li>
                    </ul>
				</section>

				<section>
                    <h2>Code quality management</h2>
                    <p><strong>Emergent design</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Isolate useful functionality in separate code packages as soon as they appear as isolated conceptual units.</li>
                        <li>Do not wait. It will be too late if you do.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Enhancement proposals</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Study a feature and its effects before processing and prioritising for implementation.</li>
                        <li>Not epics, not specs: like Python Enhancement Proposals</li>
                    </ul>
				</section>

				<section>
                    <h2>Code quality management - Technical debt</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Refactoring rarely happens as part of a user story<br /><small>Quick and easy wins the day today, but piles up tomorrow.</small></li>
                        <li>Developers are customers too.<br /><small>Want improved development efficiency. Not addressing this costs time, hence money.</small></li>
                        <li><strong>User stories</strong>: add positive value. <strong>Technical stories</strong>: remove negative value.</li>
                        <li>Sprints keep a 20% SP allocation to address <strong>relevant</strong> technical stories.</li>
                        <li>Team (not PO) prioritises tech stories.</li>
                    </ul>

				<section>
                    <h2>Team productivity and flow - 1</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Establish flow.</li>
                        <li>Ensure quiet working condition from external disruption.</li>
                        <li>Ensure no other meetings during the sprint. End of sprint day for Lunch &amp; Learn/training/cleanup</li>
                        <li>Ensure the team can communicate within itself, but not disrupt other teams.
                        <small>(Open spaces are terrible on this regard. Signal/noise ratio problem)</small></li>
                        <li>Ensure colocation and uniform, reduced, focused communication channels.</li>
                        <li>Train developers on new tech with exploratory projects<br /><small>You become confident in a new technology after three usages of it</small></li>
                    </ul>

				<section>
                    <h2>Team productivity and flow - 2</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ensure that process and tools don’t break flow:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>No to obsolete/limited tools (svn, gerrit). </li>
                            <li>Yes to well-integrated, well-structured, all encompassing solutions (bitbucket, github, gitlab).</li>
                            <li>Ensure tests success is quiet. Failure is noisy, punctual, and clear.</li>
                            <li>Ensure CI failures are delivered only to the involved developer.</li>
                            <li>Use linters to remove “style fights” among developers.</li>
                            <li>Guarantee quick response from CI machines.</li>
                            <li>Guarantee always green master.</li>

				<section>
                    <h2>Team structure - 1</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reduce “bus factor”: spread knowledge, but...</li>
                        <li>...developers <strong>are not interchangeable or relocatable</strong> on a whim. Some people excel in some techniques/parts of the code, are less efficient in others.</li>
                        <li>Reject “tragedy of the commons”/“Someone else’s problem” effect.  Developers should have <b>loose</b> ownership of code (not strict, not common).</li>
                        <li>Make developers feel excellent, dependable, consistent, aware, expert, but not a single point of failure.</li>
                        <li>Prevent the blame game by ensuring pre-merge review and mitigating strategies.</li>
                    </ul>
				</section>

				<section>
                    <h2>Team structure - 2</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Every software subsystem should have a designated “owner” that is the contact for inquires.</li>
                        <li>Import members from other teams as needed: e.g. for the duration of the sprint, borrow someone from the core team to tackle API extensions to the core in parallel to frontend changes. </li>
                        <li>Teams are built around goals. They are generally fixed because the goals are fixed and the required expertise is fixed. But that’s a coincidence that may not always hold.</li>
                        <li>Team members should be interviewing and approving new employee candidates if the team is expanding. They will work together, so they must understand each other.</li>
                    </ul>
				</section>

				<section>
                    <h2>Interaction with external teams</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Interaction generally relative to the interface their code presents (or needs to present) to others.</li>
                        <li>Define interface extensions together with the external team.
                        <small>(however, one has to ensure the external team Scrum process can accept these change requests)</small></li>
                        <li>Better: create cross functional team to address the sprint goal, or import one member from one team to the other.</li>
                        <li>Software architects must be involved and direct the process. Disagreement chaos always arises at the interfaces.</li>
                        <li>Address fundamental technical issues early if possible (e.g. spooling, atomicity, etc). Use best practices and tools from the start.</li>
                        <li>If the external team is on a different timezone, factor it in the process. If the external team exhibits a language barrier, favour written communication (slower, but safer).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Organisation changes</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reorganise work/management in steps.</li>
                        <li>Do not disturb mechanisms that have proven to work.</li>
                        <li>Disturb mechanisms that have proven not to work.</li>
                        <li>Disruption should be gradual. Throwing a “reorganisation grenade” in a team organisation brings everyone to a standstill, as they have to relearn the process flow while coping with the remnants of the old style and the technical work pressure. </li>
                        <li>Be aware of Systemantics (ISBN: 978-0812906745) and well-known management pitfalls (Mythical Man Month, ISBN: 0-201-83595-9)</li>
                        <li>Be aware of “eternal September effect” when adding new members. </li>
                        <li>Be aware of “death by a thousands papercuts” for team members or teams that have become/are/may become too central for operations.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Documentation policies</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Keep documentation near the code, checked in the version control</li>
                        <li>Do not overdocument</li>
                        <li>Team must learn to speak a common language: class names, library names, design patterns. This language must be simple and uniform, or confusion and onboarding complexity arises. Pick the right name early.</li>
                        <li>Archivist: some people excel at rationalising, reorganising, rephrasing, remembering and directing others to documentation. Nurture this figure.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>UI design and Human Interface Guidelines: interaction with a visual design team.</li>
                        <li>Interaction with UI translation team or contractors for language localisation.</li>
                        <li>Effective use of project management tools.</li>
